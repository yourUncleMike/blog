Yeah, this was me, circa 2016Q3, I'm ashamed to say.
This was years after 
[Jesse Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson){:target="_blank"}'s presidential run and
[Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King){:target="_blank"}'s near fatal beating,
and it seemed like every person-of-color I knew was playing the Race Card and looking to litigate.

## Something about Mary

One fateful day, a coworker -- let's call her "Mary" -- asked me if I noticed how people were treating her differently.
It was obvious where she was going with this.
She was a person of color, feeling persecuted, and on the verge of retaining an attorney.
What Mary did not realize was that our Company was about to enter a downsizing phase,
the first people to go would be contractors,
and ... you guessed it ... Mary was a contractor.

She brightened visibly when I confirmed "*Yes, people* **are** *treating you differently.*"

You can imagine her disappointment when I explained *why* people were treating her differently.

## Blackish

My opinions about how middle-class African Americans are portrayed on TV will go here.

## Amazon delivery

A young man drove up in a U-Haul truck, last week, and blocked our driveway.
He emerged from the truck with a package bearing the Amazon smile.
"*Is this 1340?*", he asked.

"*No, 1340 is the next house South*", I replied.
He confirmed that the last name on the package was indeed our neighbors' to the South, and thanked me.

"*Be safe out there*", I advised him.

"*You too, brother*", he replied.

"Brother" ...  That label felt really good, given the current situation with rioting over how [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd){:target="_blank"} was killed.

## White privilege

My lament about arriving late to the party will go here.
