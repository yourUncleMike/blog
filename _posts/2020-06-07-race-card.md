Yeah, this was me, circa 2016Q3, I'm ashamed to say.
This was years after 
[Jesse Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson){:target="_blank"}'s presidential run and
[Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King){:target="_blank"}'s near fatal beating,
and it seemed like every person-of-color I knew was playing the Race Card and looking to litigate.

## Something about Mary

Around the time of Jesse Jackson's run, a coworker -- let's call her "Mary" -- asked me if I noticed how people were treating her differently.  It was obvious where she was going with this.  She was on the verge of retaining an attorney.

What Mary did not realize was that the Company we worked for was about to undergo a downsizing, and the first people to go are contractors, and ... you guessed it ... Mary was a contractor.  She brightened visibly when I confirmed "*Yes, people are treating you differently."  You can imagine her disappointment when I explained *why* people were treating her differently.

## Blackish

My opinions about how middle-class African Americans are portrayed on TV will go here.

## Amazon delivery

A young man drove up in a U-Haul truck, last week, and blocked our driveway.
He emerged from the truck with a package bearing the Amazon smile.

"*Is this 1340?*", he asked.

"*No, 1340 is the next house South*", I replied.
He confirmed that the last name on the package was indeed our neighbors' to the South, and thanked me.

"*Be safe out there*", I advised him.

"*You too, brother*", he replied.

"Brother" ...  That label felt really good, given the current situation with rioting over how George Floyd was killed.

## White privilege

My lament about arriving late to the party will go here.
