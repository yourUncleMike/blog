# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Mary the contractor

A story about Mary will go here.

## Blackish

My opinions about how middle-class African Americans are portrayed on TV will go here.

## Amazon delivery

A young man drove up in a U-Haul truck and blocked our driveway last week.
He emerged from the truck with a package bearing the Amazon smile.

"Is this 1340?", he asked.

"No", I replied.  "1340 is one house South."

He confirmed that the name on the package was indeed that of our neighbor to the South, and thanked me.

I advised him to "Be safe out there."  "You too, brother", he replied.

"Brother" ...  That label felt really good, given the current situation with rioting over how George Floyd was killed.

## White privilege

My lament about arriving late to the party will go here.
